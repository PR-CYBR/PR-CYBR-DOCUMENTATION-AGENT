# OPORD-PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-AGENTâ€™s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be achieved through executing a setup script that utilizes TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
Clear and effective documentation is essential for the smooth operation and understanding of the PR-CYBR initiative. Updating documentation processes ensures users have the resources they need to utilize the systems efficiently.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will enable the integration of `scripts/setup.sh` into the terminal program, deploying TMUX to create four interactive windows.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The mission focuses on enhancing user access to documentation and ensuring that feedback mechanisms are well-integrated into the documentation processes.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Modify `src/main.py` to initiate the user interaction process through the setup script.
   - Adjust `scripts/setup.sh` for cloning necessary repositories and configuring TMUX windows.
   - Update `setup.py` to reflect any new dependencies related to documentation systems.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` for validation of the new functionalities in documentation.
   - Revise `README.md` to guide users through updated processes.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Establish the following terminal windows:
     - **Window 1**: Display a welcome message, options menu, and progress bar.
     - **Window 2**: Run `htop` for system monitoring.
     - **Window 3**: Use `tail -f` for monitoring logs produced by `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Display output of `ls -l` in the repository root directory.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- Keep detailed documentation records and ensure they are maintained in version control systems.
- Review effectiveness and accuracy of documentation post-implementation with users and stakeholders.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- Provide consistent updates through established PR-CYBR channels.
- Ensure that documentation updates are communicated effectively to all relevant agents.

**This OPORD directs the PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-AGENT to enhance documentation processes and align efforts with PR-CYBR goals.**
