<!--
Key Objectives:
1. Update sections to include new functionalities introduced by `git_operations.py`, `diff_communicator.py`, `issue_analyzer.py`, and `opord_analysis.py`.
2. Include examples and usage instructions for each of the new scripts to guide users.
3. Revise installation instructions if there are any new dependencies or configuration steps.
4. Provide clear documentation on how to run the new operations and integrate them into existing workflows.
5. Maintain a consistent structure and readability throughout the updated document.

# Review and Missing Components

1. `src/main.py`:
- Ensure command-line arguments and input methods are implemented to accept new parameters related to git operations and issue analysis.
- Revise user interface prompts to include options for the new features.

2. `tests/test_core_functions.py`:
- Add test cases for the new functionalities in git_operations.py, issue_analyzer.py, and opord_analysis.py.
- Implement mock objects to simulate git operations and issue fetching.

3. `requirements.txt`:
- Ensure all necessary dependencies are listed. Currently, only requests is included, which is correct for HTTP requests. 
- Verify if any other libraries are used in the scripts.

4. `src/agent_logic/core_functions.py`:
- Ensure the integration of new functionalities is complete and coherent with the main execution flow.

5. `build/Dockerfile`:
- The Dockerfile is currently empty. It needs to be populated with instructions to build the Docker image for the agent.

6. `build/docker-compose.yml`:
Ensure the configuration aligns with the deployment requirements, such as environment variables and volume mappings.

## Overview

The **PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-AGENT** ensures comprehensive and up-to-date documentation across the PR-CYBR ecosystem. It supports the generation, organization, and maintenance of technical and user-facing documentation to improve accessibility and clarity.

## Key Features

- **Automated Documentation Generation**: Utilizes tools to automatically generate API docs, system architecture diagrams, and project overviews.
- **Content Organization**: Structures documentation for intuitive navigation and readability.
- **Version Control**: Maintains versioned documentation to align with ecosystem updates.
- **Collaboration Ready**: Integrates with GitHub to streamline contributions and updates.
- **Multilingual Support**: Provides documentation in multiple languages to reach diverse audiences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for running scripts.
- **Docker**: Required for containerization and deployment.
- **Access to GitHub Actions**: For automated workflows.

### Local Setup

To set up the `PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-AGENT` locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PR-CYBR/PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-AGENT.git
cd PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-AGENT
```

2. **Run Local Setup Script**

```bash
./scripts/local_setup.sh
```
_This script will install necessary dependencies and set up the local environment._

3. **Provision the Agent**

```bash
./scripts/provision_agent.sh
```
_This script configures the agent with default settings for local development._

### Cloud Deployment

To deploy the agent to a cloud environment:

1. **Configure Repository Secrets**

- Navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` in your GitHub repository.
- Add the required secrets:
     - `CLOUD_API_KEY`
     - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
     - `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD`
     - Any other cloud-specific credentials.

2. **Deploy Using GitHub Actions**

- The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/docker-compose.yml`.
- Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the deployment workflow automatically.

3. **Manual Deployment**

- Use the deployment script for manual deployment:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_agent.sh
```

- Ensure you have Docker and cloud CLI tools installed and configured on your machine.

## Integration

The `PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-AGENT` integrates with other PR-CYBR agents to provide comprehensive and consistent documentation. It communicates with:

- **PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT**: Updates management-level documentation and reports.
- **PR-CYBR-DEVELOPER-AGENT**: Coordinates documentation contributions from developers.
- **PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT**: Integrates documentation generation into CI/CD pipelines.
- **PR-CYBR-USER-FEEDBACK-AGENT**: Incorporates user feedback into documentation improvements.

## Usage

- **Development**

  - Generate documentation locally:

    ```bash
    python setup.py develop
    ```

  - Modify or add documentation content in the `docs/` directory.

- **Testing**

  - Run tests to ensure documentation integrity:

    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```

- **Building for Production**

  - Build the agent and generate documentation for production use:

    ```bash
    python setup.py install
    ```
